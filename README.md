# Chess-and-AI
This is my final project from my advanced training in data and process analysis.


# Overview


This project is the result of my advanced training in data and process analysis. It is a chess game programmed based on a tutorial, featuring sound effects and various board colors. The game includes all standard chess rules and is enhanced with a model that recognizes the board position and translates it into FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) using PyTorch. From the FEN notation, the best move can be determined.

# Features


Complete Chess Game: Implements all standard chess rules.
Sound Effects: Enjoy an immersive experience with sound effects for moves, captures, and check/checkmate notifications.
Customizable Board Colors: Choose from a variety of board color themes to personalize your game.
Board Position Recognition: A PyTorch model that recognizes the board position and translates it into FEN notation.
Best Move Calculation: Once the board position is translated into FEN notation, the best move is determined.

IÂ´m still trying to improve it.
